  They will cycle from <strong>Land&rsquo;s End to John o&rsquo;Groats</strong> &ndash; a distance of approximately 1000 miles and they will do this without a support vehicle (i.e. they will carry their own equipment, clothes etc while cycling).<br>
  <br>
                          They would greatly appreciate your support and therefore encourage you to sponsor them in their efforts which you can do as follows:</p>
                      <p>You can donate now by clicking this link: <a href="https://secure.givenow.org/charitysearch/CharityDetails.asp?Src=CAF&ID=350689&SID=282827&OrgName=Teach+Ghana+Trust&GUID=" target="_blank">cafonline.org<br>

After 18miles along a &quot;back road&quot; we reached Okehampton and shortly after this we were overtaken by a chap who was doing the same stupid thing. But... he has a support vehicle - a big campervan which met him every hour or two with food/drink/place to rest comfortably. It also carries any belongings so he has a 'naked' bike which is a racer (unlike our hybrids) and he's been training. All of this made us feel he was cheating and we concluded that he wasn't really doing something particularly difficult! A nice fella though all the same! </p>
                        <p> We made it to Crediton (36miles) at the bottom of a steep hill where we lunched for a few hours (Roscoe may well have set a PB for number of roast potates eaten in one meal... 14).</p>
                        <p> Set off for Taunton which, slightly unsurprisingly meant a big uphill start. This was combined with northerly winds which made life even more difficult (it was windy enough that we couldn't freewheel down gentle downhills). </p>
                        <p>                          We finally made it to Taunton shortly before 7pm taking our distance from Land's End clear of 150 miles which we're quite happy with. Unfortunately we are feeling the effects and we may cycle a reduced length tomorrow.<BR>

                        <p>A swift phone call was returned by by Richard while we were ascending a steep 1mile hill. He informed us that he thought he had found a potentially good diversion and this turned out to be a very good one taking us through Ludlow before picking up the A49 again. We continued on to a little village called Craven Arms wishing we'd stopped for lunch at Ludlow and only finding a fish &amp; chip shop which opened just as we were arriving. After a greasy lunch we completed the final 2hrs of our journey to Shrewsbury with another 80mile day under our belts. </p></td>

                        There may be a little damage as it keeps making odd noises. This is not good! We had  lunch in Carlisle and then had 4miles along a busy dual carriageway which had narrowed lands due to roadworks. A few vehicles seemed to object to our presence but we survived unscathed making it to Gretna - finally into Scotland! We finished off with what we'd hoped would be a relatively easy 17miles to Lockerbie but the winds picked up and made it a struggle to even go downhill. Anyway, more than 70miles done today and our total is now over 500 miles.<br>

Here's where the problems started - bank holiday weekend did not help and it wasn't long before several places had advised us we wouldn't find somewhere. So we headed to Cumbernauld.

Richard had little luck but as he managed to find some university amodation we found a not very pleasant place in a little place called Denny at not the greatest price and took it. <br>

However, despite starting off quite late by our standards, we were in Brora by 1pm so we decided to have lunch and take on the two steepest hills of the journey. Before we knew it our legs were aching after a 13% ascent but we'd made it up the hills clocking up 61 miles. It was only 5pm and with the hills out of the way and the rest allegedly flat, we decided to go on to the only major(ish) town before John o'Groats - Wick. We expected the 20 miles to take around an hour and a half.</p>
                        <p> After approximately a minute Roscoe bagged himself a buy one get one free bargain on bike problems with a puncture (not really a problem that can't be easily solved) and a knackered link in his chain. <br>
                          <br>
                          It was raining. A lot. Fortunately we were outside a house that was under a lot of renovation which advertised B&amp;B. I enquired to discover that it came in the form of their caravan. But they were very kind and offered to let us try and fix the bike under shelter which we quickly accepted. We thought we'd fixed it and set off at around 5:40. As expected the puncture was fixed but the chain was clearly not. <br>
                          <br>
                          After a 
                          call to Cycle-control's Chris, we managed to get hold of a bike shop in Wick. We persuaded the guy to come out in his car with neccessary tools which he did and fixed the bike without accepting the extra money we offered him. The family who'd offered us shelter provided us with a pot of tea and some shortbread and Roscoe fixed their daughter's computer, eventually. They gave us the number of the only place we might get dinner which was successful and the number of a b&amp;b 3 iles up the road which we beat some other cyclists to and arrived there at 9pm. So much for our &quot;nice, easy 36 mile day&quot;! Good news is that we only have around 40 miles to John o'Groats left and it's supposed to be pretty flat from here so only the winds to struggle against...</p></td>
